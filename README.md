U.B. Taiko Pattern Trainer

A dedicated, lightweight training tool designed for Taiko no Tatsujin players.
Focus on drilling complex patterns, improving stream consistency, and refining rhythm accuracy with arcade-strict timing windows.

✨ Why did I make it?

Standard simulators are great for playing songs, but they aren't optimized for drilling specific rudiments. I wanted a way to:

Isolate patterns: Practice triplets, DDK, or long streams repeatedly.

Strict Timing: Feedback is based on official Arcade windows (Perfect: 25ms).

Measure Accuracy: A real-time graph shows if you are hitting Early or Late.

Improve Sight-Reading: Use the Auto-Randomize feature for infinite reading exercises.

🎮 Features

Visualizer Mode: Interactive metronome for checking audio sync or warming up.

Game Mode: Full training experience with scoring, combo tracking, and accuracy stats.

Demo Play: Let the CPU play the pattern perfectly to internalize the rhythm.

Dynamic Sequencer: 32-step editor to draw your own custom patterns.

Preset Library: Built-in common rudiments (Streams, Triplets, Alt-sticking).

Coach Mode: Get analysis and tips (e.g., "Hitting Early -> Adjust Offset").

🛡️ Security & Antivirus Note

Since this is an independent, non-signed open-source project, Windows SmartScreen or some Antivirus software might flag the executable as "Unknown" or "Suspicious".

This is a False Positive.

Why? The app is compiled using PyInstaller, which is often flagged by heuristic engines because it extracts files to a temporary folder.

Verification: You can check the source code yourself here on GitHub to verify the logic.

Solution: Click "More info" and "Run anyway" if prompted by Windows.
